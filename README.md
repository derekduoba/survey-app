# SurveyTimeA simple survey app designed to help people create hassle-free polls on the quick.SurveyTime allows users to create single-question, multi-answer polls in a matter of minutes. Surveys can be accessed viaunique URLs generated at creation time. Each survey also includes a simple results view.Users are prevented from answering multiple times through the use of browser cookies (although this can be subvertedwith relative ease).In addition to single-survey views, the app also includes multi-question and batch result views.```Note: This app is a work in progress. Expect it to change frequently.```## Built With* Node.JS (Stable)* Express* Jade* jQuery* Bootstrap 4* SASS* MySQL* SequelizeJS## How to Use### Deploying SurveyTime```Coming to a README.md near you ASAP```### URLs```/```The main survey-creation view.```/create-question```Another way to access the main survey-creation view.```/question/:questionID```The default single survey / question view.
